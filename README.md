===============

This is the source code behind [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).

The  idea  of this  service  is  inspired from  [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com).
I thought that use the whole framework (node.js with express.js)
for such a simple thing as requests proxying is overkill and
made the same stuff using nginx only.

This is also a game: I am trying to implement the same functionality using nginx
config files only. No programming languages allowed. Come join me!
